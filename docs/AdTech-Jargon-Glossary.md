## This is a jargon-buster glossary -- short explanations for the terms we use. It's for AdTech terms, and for our own company jargon.

* AdTech: advertising technology.

* Cost-per-completed-view (CPCV): The price for a completed video view. The definition of "completed" can vary depending on the platform -- from the whole video, to just 3 seconds (Facebook ads)! We use "completed" = 15 seconds.

* Cost-per-thousand-impressions (CPM): The price for 1,000 impressions, which is the standard pricing for banner ads.

* Demand-side platform (DSP): Where advertisers setup campaigns.

* Supply / Sell -side platform (SSP): Where publishers manage their inventory.

* Insertion Order (IO): When a brand manually places an order for some inventory. This is how everyone bought media before programmatic exchanges came along.

* Inventory: Space where ads can be shown. This can include the whole range of print ads, banner ads, interstitials, etc.

* Impressions: The individual ad spots. E.g. "We bought some inventory from The New York Times - 1,000 impressions."

* Programmatic: The system of ad-exchanges and automated realtime bidding (RTB) used by most online advertising.

* VAST: a standard wrapper (from the IAB) for video adverts which can include tracking calls.

* VPAID: supports video + js for interactive video ads, or more tracking.
