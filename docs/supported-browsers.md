## The AdUnits

Our policy is for all adunit variants to work excellently across browsers with 5% or more share of traffic, 
and to work OK for browsers setups with 1% - 5% of traffic share (though older devices might not have quite the best design).

For browser/device setups with less than 1% of traffic share - we would like to support these too, but we may release code which doesn't work perfectly.

Overall, we should serve a premium experience to at least 95% of requests.

We measure traffic share from <code>visible</code> events in our logs (i.e. we're looking at the market we serve).
