# Performance Review: 360 Feedback

Colleague being reviewed: 

Please give feedback, positive and negative, on your colleague. 
Any negative feedback will be kept anonymous. 
Positive feedback is assumed to be good to share (say if you want it to be anonymous).

Note to management: If there is negative feedback, do not pass on details that would
allow for de-anonimisation. Instead, use it to inform the discussion. One way to do
this is to talk about the underlying skills/behaviours relating to the feedback. 

Try to give 1-3 examples. You can leave questions blank.
