# Commission and Bonus Policy

Legal note: Commission and bonuses are at the Company's discretion, and the Company can always change the policy. They do not form part
of staff contracts, and there is no entitlement or accrued liability from them.

## Sales Commission

In Q1 of the year, we set annual targets. On target commission is 40% of base salary. This is based on revenue secured versus revenue targets, with a mixed weighting for individual and team results.

A sales person can earn more (or less) than their On Target Earnings (OTE) depending on performance. We track OTE vs actual earnings to check that our targets are about right.

Sales commission is paid quarterly, the month after the quarter ending.

## Revenue share

All staff who do not receive sales commission get a 2% share of campaign profits.

"Campaign profit" is defined as sales income, minus cost-of-sales: donations / media / brand studies / platform fees / sales commission.

Payments are made bi-annually with the timing set by the company.

## End-of-Year (Christmas) Bonus

Each year, there is an end of year bonus paid in December, based on overall commercial performance.

A typical amount might be £500 per person for hitting the commercial performance targets, and £1,000 each for reaching the commercial stretch goals.

So far, the Good-Loop team have always hit not only our performance targets, but also our stretch goals.
