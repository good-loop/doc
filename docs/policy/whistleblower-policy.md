# Whistleblower Policy

Good-Loop is committed to maintaining the highest standards of 
integrity, and takes very seriously all good
faith complaints and concerns regarding accounting, data, legality, and internal controls and auditing matters. 
Our policies and practices have been developed to maintain the highest business, legal and
ethical standards.

Therefore, it is policy for employees, when they reasonably believe that
illegal activity or questionable accounting, data, or auditing practices have occurred or are occurring, 
to report those concerns (on an anonymous basis, if the employee so desires). All good faith reports will be
taken seriously and will be promptly investigated. All information disclosed during the course of the
investigation will remain confidential, except as necessary to conduct the investigation and take any
remedial action.

Any employee reporting concerns of this nature has a lawful right to raise these concerns
without fear of harassment, discrimination or retaliation. The Company strictly prohibits discrimination,
retaliation or harassment of any kind against any employee who, based on the employee's reasonable
belief that such conduct has occurred, reports that information pursuant to this Policy.

## What Counts for Whistleblowing?

> ### Complaints that do not count as whistleblowing
