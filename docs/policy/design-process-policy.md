Why is a policy needed? Because frustrations have arisen across the teams.

Design work *should* follow the process below. Anyone is allowed to short-cut this process if they judge that time is of the essence. That should not be a regular occurrence.

1. Include everyone from the start: i.e. tech should loop in commercial, and commercial should loop in tech. Otherwise we get surprises and problems, plus people can't contribute. Handy emails: `sales@good-loop.com`, `edinburgh.team@good-loop.com`, `wholeteam@good-loop.com`. You can also use `@all` in a chat channel. If there's dev work involved, always email Dan W, as he'll have to manage that.

2. Articulate the business case (i.e. why can't we just use existing stuff?). Just a few lines in an email is enough. People can question this.

3. If the design is for an adunit -- use the Portal first, and if it doesn't produce what you want, state what's missing. Do not produce mockups using e.g. photoshop without first talking to dev. Otherwise we risk promising things we don't deliver.

4. The content and sketch UX/UI design should be done first. Circulate this for feedback.

5. Then send this to a graphic designer (probably Emilia) to make it pretty. There's a spreadsheet of tasks here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wXNUafP7-aFZFoyBqIaePCDhWNdyZz7qW84WhkpL-9s/edit#gid=0

6. The graphic designer sends out designs. Circulate these for feedback.

7. The dev work gets scheduled. All dev work should be done in a planned way as part of a monthly sprint. That said, we will need faster turn-around at times. Fast turn-around comes at the cost of extra work (testing work has to be repeated, so we lose a couple of days), plus extra stress -- so do try to avoid it.

3. The developer implements it. If the developer has changed the design, they should circulate this for feedback.

4. It gets tested.

5. It gets published. Tech should let everyone know when work is released.

## On Feedback

As a creator, please *do share draft work*. It's much better to get feedback early in the process! Just mark it as draft, and no-one will judge you for sharing early-stage unfinished work.

As a critic, please do give feedback on both large and small issues -- but don't get bogged down in small issues. Sometimes a design needs a big overhaul, and tinkering with the details can get in the way. Also, there may be other priorities.

All feedback comes with the implicit caveat: "provided this is not too much hassle and will not mess up the code or make it fragile"

People can choose not to implement feedback -- just let the person know. It's enough to say "Not done for technical/aesthetic/UX reasons". If the person disagrees or thinks it is important enough to justify extra technical work, they can say so.
