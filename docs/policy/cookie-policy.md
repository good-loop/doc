<!-- Note: We were asked (well: told) to put something like this into our privacy policy by Google Advertising Network, when they onboarded us as an ad-serving company.
If you don't confirm, we won't set cookies - but we'll keep asking you in adverts when we get the chance. If you say no, we'll stop asking.

Let us track your donations and ad-watching with cookies?
This raises more money for charity by picking more relevant adverts. You can opt-out at any time by clicking "no" on this page.
