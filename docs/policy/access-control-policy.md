## Client Data

Acceptable use: Client data must be treated as confidential and may only be looked at as part of serving that client's needs.

## Development Data

Examples: Source code

## Use and disposal of media

Removable and printed media should be used only when necessary, and the data should be deleted as soon as possible. An additional reason for avoiding printed media is to reduce environmental waste.

All media should be securely disposed off, either by physical destruction (for CDs and paper records), or by secure scrubbing (hard drives, flash drives).
