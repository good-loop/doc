# Business Continuity Plan

Good-Loop aims to respond rapidly and effectively to emergencies in a way that
minimizes disruption to our client engagements and other operations.

## People

To ensure that projects can continue even if the lead person suffers
serious illness or injury, secondary people are kept briefed on the
engagement.

## Documents, data, and systems

We implement measures to ensure that we have a scalable infrastructure
with multiple redundancies. This infrastructure can be rapidly repaired
in the event of disaster or catastrophic hardware failure.

All digital assets are either:

a. Stored in Google Drive, which provides a secure robust cloud storage platform.

or

b. Stored in a secure off-site repository. This repository is
replicated to two further locations nightly.

Databases critical for production use a distributed server setup.
Databases are backed up on a nightly basis and replicated off-site.

### Testing

Failover testing of server clusters is done on a monthly basis as part of our release QA.

Integrity testing of database backups is done on a quarterly basis.

## Workplace

Good-Loop's work does not rely upon our office. All our researchers
have the capacity to work both when on location and from home. All
documents and software code are stored using multiple off-site
repositories (see _documents and systems_ above). We can therefore
recover even from a serious office disaster such as fire or flood with
only minor disruption.

## Financial

Good-Loop operates a careful financial policy. A percentage of profit
is retained to provide a solid buffer against financial changes.
