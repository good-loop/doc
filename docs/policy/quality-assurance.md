# Quality Assurance Policy: Maintaining high standards

## Overview

Good-Loop aims to provide high quality services and products through continuous
improvement of its standards and performance. The Company is committed to meeting the needs of all
its clients and stakeholders.

This policy provides a framework for decisions and actions which assure and improve the
quality of provision.

## Policy Objectives

 - To support the Company in delivering reliable high-quality services.
 - To provide the operational guidelines for a high standard of service to all
our clients.
 - To ensure a comprehensive, sound and integrated approach to Company activity
that is understood by and accessible to all staff.

## Policy

 - <i>Targets:</i> All projects will establish clear targets, and a plan for achieving them. Performance will be reviewed at the end of the project and on a regular basis during the project.
 - <i>Audit Trails:</i> All projects will maintain an audit trail.
This is implemented in a transparent and rigorous way using a version-control system.
 - <i>Peer review:</i> All project work is subject to internal review by a suitably qualified peer.
 - <i>Continuous Improvement:</i> A culture of continuous improvement will be fostered by the Company. All employees will be encouraged to provide feedback on Company practice. Employees with ideas for improvements will be supported.
 - <i>Assessment:</i> An annual self-assessment will be conducted at whole-Company and sector levels, leading to action plans for continuous improvement. To inform this, the Company will obtain and evaluate the views of clients on the quality of the Company's services and respond appropriately.
 - <i>Consistency:</i> The Company will ensure consistency of standards through the implementation of appropriate quality assurance
systems and procedures.

## Software Development, Testing & Release

We use a combination of quality assurance techniques to provide a high quality of software.

 - Development is done in clearly defined sprints following best practice processes.
 - Version control (using git) is used to manage feature development and release versions. See our [Git Workflow Process](./git-policy.md) for details.
 - Fresh code is peer-reviewed using git pull requests. Peer review can be relaxed in urgent situations.
 - We have a dedicated testing phase for each release. This includes testing by non-developers. 
 - Quality monitoring is built into the software itself, with automatic alerts if there is an issue.
