# Good-Loop and the GDPR

## Is it valid to incentivise data collection?

Yes :)

The issue arises because consent from the user must be "freely given", and that means you cannot make consent a requirement
for a service unless it is _needed_ for the service. This sounds like a problem for incentivised data collection
(since the data isn't needed for the incentive). However the ICO advice on this matter allows for things like
loyalty schemes, where data collection is incentivised.

> The ICO's view is that it may still be possible to incentivise consent to some extent.
> There will usually be some benefit to consenting to processing.
> For example, if joining the retailer's loyalty scheme comes with access to money-off vouchers, there is clearly some incentive to consent
> to marketing. The fact that this benefit is unavailable to those who don't sign up does not amount to a detriment for refusal.
> However, you must be careful not to cross the line and unfairly penalise those who refuse consent.
