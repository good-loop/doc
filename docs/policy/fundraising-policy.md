We aim to follow the FundRaising Regulator's code-of-practice and fundraising-promise as non-binding guidelines.

We will refer to these rules if in doubt. Staff or the public can also hold us to account against these rules (with us either correcting for an omission, or providing an explanation if we don't follow a rule).

Note: we have not registered to pay the FR annual fees.
