# Image Policy

This policy is for using images in our website or other publications.

## Copyright

Images should either:

- (a) Belong to Good-Loop,
- or (b) be logos -- it's OK to use another company's logo when referring to them (there's a disclaimer in the website footer to say that the 3rd party owns their logo),
- or (c) come from a site like <unsplash.com> that allows reuse.
  - If you use creative-commons (e.g. Flickr has a creative-commons search), then please name the file `{image name}_cc_{author}_{site eg flickr}.jpg` so we can include an attribution comment.
- or (d) have approval from the owner (e.g. with case-study docs, we ask the brand for approval).

## File Format: .svg, .png, or .jpg

Send decent quality files. We can down-scale a file to make a smaller version. Going the opposite way is much harder.

## People in photos

For "amateur" photos (taken by us or found on Flickr): If there are recognisable people in a photo - ask for their consent, and keep an email record. Be especially careful if there are children in the photo! Get consent from their parent or guardian.

This does not apply to professional photos - e.g. from adverts or from unsplash.
