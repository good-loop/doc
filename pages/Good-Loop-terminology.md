# Good-Loop Terminology

See: 

* [AdUnit Taxonomy](dev/adunit-taxonomy.html)
* [Logging metrics](Canonical-Terminology-for-Logging-Good-Loop-Events.html)

## Advert Products

We mostly deliver standard advert formats, like pre-roll vpaid. However we also have a couple of
Good-Loop specific products.

 * Video Player Page (the `player`). A destination page that shows a video ad. https://demo.good-loop.com

 * Campaign Page

 * Do-Good Wrapper (the `wrapper`). A banner advert, which links through to the brand's landing page
  -- but with a special Good-Loop wrapper, that adds a donate-to-charity widget to the top of the page.
  It's a banner ad - but one that does good and leaves viewers feeling good. Sold on a CPC basis.

* `Splash Video` : A reference to the looped 9x16 video that is seen on a Snapchat advert

* `Social Post-Swipe Page` : A reference to 'that thing that you see after swiping up on an Instagram advert'.
    - [Example](https://testsocial.good-loop.com/generic/index.html?gl.vert=test_wide_multiple)
    - (As of Oct 2020) - Any and all assets must be hand-rolled by a developer or at least coded by someone using HTML and CSS.  All adverts are treated individually -- So, all work is considered one-off work.
