See: 

* [AdUnit Taxonomy](dev/adunit-taxonomy.html)
* [Logging metrics](Canonical-Terminology-for-Logging-Good-Loop-Events.html)

## Advert Products

We mostly deliver standard advert formats, like pre-roll vpaid. However we also have a couple of
Good-Loop specific products.

 * Video Player Page (the `player`). A destination page that shows a video ad. https://as.good-loop.com

 * Campaign Page

 * Do-Good Wrapper (the `wrapper`). A banner advert, which links through to the brand's landing page
  -- but with a special Good-Loop wrapper, that adds a donate-to-charity widget to the top of the page.
  It's a banner ad - but one that does good and leaves viewers feeling good. Sold on a CPC basis.
