# Bug Bounty Scheme

If you find a bug or a vulnerability in our systems -- Please report it to support@good-loop.com, and thank you for doing so.

We pay a bug bounty to the first person to report a bug (with regret, if the bug is already known then there is no payment). The payment is based on our assessment of how serious the bug is.
Typical payments are $50 or $100, but payments can be higher.

As well as a pyament to the bug bounty hunter, they can also name a charity, and we will donate $10 to the charity.

This bug bounty scheme is subject to you agreeing to HackerOne's guidelines on bug bounties:

 - You be the first reporter of the vulnerability.
 - You follow https://hackerone.com/disclosure-guidelines
 - You do not access data of other users and solely use your created accounts.
 - You may not publicly disclose the vulnerability prior to our resolution.
 - You provide a working proof of concept that exploits the security issue.
