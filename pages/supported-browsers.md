# Supported Browsers and Devices

## The AdUnits

Our policy is for all adunit variants to work excellently across browsers with 5% or more market share, 
and to work OK for browsers setups with 1% - 5% of market share (though older devices might not have quite the best design).

For browser/device setups with less than 1% of market share - we would like to support these too, but we may release code which doesn't work perfectly.

Overall, we should serve a premium experience to at least 95% of requests.

Hello Dan - Could you put some notes in for what we do and don't support?
Thanks, 
Dan

## The Portal

The Portal is for advertisers and publishers to manage their accounts. 
We expect the Portal to work across most browsers, but we only officially support the latest versions of Chrome and FireFox.
