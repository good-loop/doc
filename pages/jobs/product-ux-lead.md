## About Good-Loop Ltd

Good-Loop takes money from advertisers, and gives it to charities.   
But Good-Loop is not itself a charity: we do this by making ads more effective. We are turning ads from a nuisance to be blocked, into a shared positive moment which funds social and environmental good. We also believe in treating internet users fairly, empowering them to be partners in the advertising and data ecosystem. Clients include Unilever, Kit-Kat, and Pepsi. Last year we raised over £500,000 for charity. This year we will double that.

If you are a recruiter with a good candidate -- email us their CV, and a short portfolio from them as above. Also include a statement of your fees. The next stage is an online technical challenge -- We arrange that directly with the candidate, so you must include their contact details. We promise to keep you in the loop throughout the process.
