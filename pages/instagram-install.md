## You can use Good-Loop to monetise your Instagram profile and raise funds for your chosen charitable causes! Here's how:

1. Create your Good-Loop page URL:<code>https://as.good-loop.com/?site=<your instagram username>.instagram</code>
Changing <code><your instagram username></code> to, well, your instagram username.

2. Add your Good-Loop page link to your bio so that people can click on it to support you 

3. Contact us to select which charities you'd like to support and to setup your bank details.

4. To keep earning, you'll want to post images to your followers about the link every so often. We have some templates you can use for this. We suggest using a calendar or HootSuite to make that an easy routine.
