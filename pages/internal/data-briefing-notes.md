# Good-Loop Tech and Data Briefing Notes

Audience: This doc is for PR and marketing staff

Good-Loop is an ad-*tech* company, with proprietary bidding 
and an innovative better-for-everyone take on data management.

## Why talk about tech and data?

Why not just focus 100% of our PR and marketing on the core ads-for-good story?

 - **Depth** A challenge we've heard from every investor, and from some customers,
 is that it'd be easy to copy what we do. Actually, there's more to it than you
 first realise, as is often the case. Talking about our tech addresses that 
 misperception, and so will help with investment, plus will slightly deter copy-cats.

 - **Thought Leadership** We'd like personal data to be managed better. Let's be part of making that happen.

 - **PR** Ads-for-Good is our main story, but the press won't repeat it too often. 
 Tech and data provide more opportunities for Good-Loop press stories.

Note: much of the dev team's work is on "everyday" coding -- this is not covered here, because, whilst it is vital, 
it generally doesn't make for PR stories.

## The Elevator Summary

Good-Loop will empower users to put their data to work, raising even more money for good causes.
We'll provide easy ways for the general public to manage their data. 
This user data then provides high quality fuel for the custom AI we're developing.

## Our Ethos: Treat the public as partners, not targets

We aim to empower people. That means our tech must be easy-to-use, and not take much a time 
(we provide value to users within *just a few clicks*!).

We do NOT sell people's data. We take privacy seriously -- see our [privacy policy](https://doc.good-loop.com/policy/privacy-policy.html).

We sell services which are enabled by data. For example, selecting relevant adverts based on your profile -- but without
sharing your data with the advertiser.

## What Data?

Data is the fuel for the modern digital economy.

We manage two valuable data-sets:

### 1. My.Good-Loop.com

Your personal data is valuable. Boost the money you raise for charity by
letting us hold and manage profile data. 

 - This is opt-in! We are against spyware and the surveillance of normal people.
 - We aim to show users what data we hold on them, and how it is used.
 - Quick and easy! E.g. just connect your Facebook, Twitter, or email account, and My.Good-Loop will 
 pipe in the data.


### 2. Performance data 

This is data on how our ads perform, which helps us to show ads to the right people in the right context.

Users behave differently to Good-Loop's ads -- because they are a different experience. 
That means a generic ad-placement AI does not work well for us. 
So we have collected our own data-set, and will deploy our own AI.

Data is the food for AIs, and good quality data is vital.

Our performance data is a mix of anonymous data plus the richer data from My.Good-Loop.com

## What Technology?

 - AdUnits. A suite of products to deliver the Good-Loop ads-for-good experience.

 - AdServer. A high performance scalable adserver, which supports video, digital display (i.e. banner ads), and social media.

 - Profile Database. Designed to manage uncertain and conflicting data, 
 whilst tracking the source and permissions. Benefits: GDPR compliance, 
 monetisation (we can attribute and reward multiple data owners),
 higher quality of data.

We are working on:

 - Custom AI
 - Deeper integration with the advertising ecosystem -- including data services.

## Partly Open Source (because we're partly nice people)

If we build great software, it is because we're standing on the shoulders of giants
 -- thanks to free open-source software.

 We contribute back: whilst we do keep some code private, 
 we have released several projects for public use. Our open-source projects have been downloaded over 1/2 million times,
 and have featured in teaching courses.
