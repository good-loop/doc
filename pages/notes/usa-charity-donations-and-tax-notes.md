# US Charity Donations and Tax - Good-Loop Informal Notes

**Disclaimer: Good-Loop _cannot_ provide tax advice. These are our informal and unqualified opinions. Clients should consult a qualified tax advisor.**

Date: 25th August 2020   

Yes: The client can claim the donation part for tax relief, provided they receive an acknowledgement from the charity -- which we can do for them.

Obviously it is only the payment to the charities which qualify. 
Media fees, the client's agency fees, and Good-Loop fees are not charitable donations.

The written acknowledgement is defined by the IRS here: https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/charitable-contributions-written-acknowledgments

There is also a time requirement (see p526): 

> Contemporaneous written acknowledgment  
> You must get it on or before the earlier of:   
> a. The date you file your return for the year you make the contribution; or   
> b. The due date, including extensions, for filing the return.

IRS publication 526 has details and examples: https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p526.pdf

A key part is the handling of contributions from which you benefit:

> If you receive a benefit as a result of making a
contribution to a qualified organization, you can
deduct only the amount of your contribution that
is more than the value of the benefit you receive. 
...
> For
the excess amount to qualify, you must pay it
with the intent to make a charitable contribution.
>
>Example 1. You pay $65 for a ticket to a
dinner dance at a church. Your entire $65 payment goes to the church. The ticket to the dinner dance has a fair market value of $25. When
you buy your ticket, you know its value is less
than your payment. To figure the amount of
your charitable contribution, subtract the value
of the benefit you receive ($25) from your total
payment ($65). You can deduct $40 as a charitable contribution to the church.

## Sponsorship / Advertising

But wait: Surely advertising related sponsorship doesn't count as charity?

For Good-Loop ads, the payment to the charity is OK, because no benefits
are attached to that. 
The benefits are attached to the media-and-fees part of the campaign costs.

See IRS rules on sponsorship & advertising: 
IRC Sec. 513(c) – Advertising, IRC Sec. 
513(i) – Qualified Sponsorship Payments. 
https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/advertising-or-qualified-sponsorship-payments

Let's highlight some key bits:

> [for] a purchase of an item of value (advertising), the presumption is that no gift has been made.

But:

> Advertising does not include acknowledgements.

> Treas. Reg. 1.513-4(c)(2) provides that if there is an arrangement or expectation that the payor will receive a substantial return benefit with respect to any payment, then only the portion of the payment that exceeds the fair market value of the substantial return benefit is a qualified sponsorship payment.   
...   
> Substantial return benefit is defined Treas. Reg. 1.513-4(c)(2)(ii) as any benefit other than a use or acknowledgement (explained below) or disregarded benefits.

There is no arrangement or expectation associated with the payment to the charity. The charity does nothing in return.

Benefits could include rights to use the charity logo, 

> Rights to an intangible asset such as a trademark, patent, logo or designation of the exempt organization.

Fortunately a Good-Loop client is not entitled to use the charity logos as a result of the payment.

### IRS Issue Indicators or Audit Tips re Sponsorship

This is the checklist the IRS gives at https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/advertising-or-qualified-sponsorship-payments

> Review contracts for sponsorship payments to determine if:
> 
> - The "sponsor" received any substantial return benefit. Payments are contingent upon the level of attendance.
> - The payment entitles the payor to the use or acknowledgement of the name or logo (or product lines) of the payor's trade or business in periodicals.
> - The payment is made in connection with any qualified convention or trade show activity
An exclusive provider arrangement exists.

No to all of those, so that's fine.

> Determine if the use or acknowledgement contains:
> 
> - qualitative or comparative language
> - price information
> - indications of savings or value
> - an endorsement or an inducement to purchase, sell, or use such products or services.

This use or acknowledgement is by the charity (or in their name). The charity itself is not expected to make any public use or acknowledgement, nor is it endorsing any such statements.

Of course, the client's advert itself may contain these! But that is separate.
We are clear with viewers that the charities are not endorsing the advert.
