# Wordpress Ad Plugins Notes #

## New Method ##

The fastest way to get started with GoodLoop on WordPress is to use our official WordPress plugin. No special set up is required: just install the plugin and place a "Good-Loop ad unit" on your page.

1) Install via the WordPress admin interface by going to "Plugins" -> "Add New" and searching for "Good-loop"
OR [download the plugin files](https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/good-loop-ad-widget.zip) and upload them to your server's /wp-content/plugins/good-loop-ad-widget directory 

2) Activate the plugin (plugins are activated on your site's WordPress admin page. See "Plugins" -> "Installed Plugins")

3) Go to the Appearance -> Widgets menu

4) Drag-and-drop a “Good-Loop ad unit” (found under “Available Widgets”) into one of the sidebars

The adunit should now be running happily on your page. For further information, including how to get paid, please refer to the "Settings" -> "Good-Loop" page

If you are unable to set up the adunit by following the above instructions, or if you'd like to tell us what you think about the plugin, contact us at publishers@good-loop.com.
