# Expenses Policy

## Guidelines: What should and should not be expensed?

In general, we want a culture of trust, care, and common sense. 
Treat Good-Loop money with the same care as you treat your own -- being neither stingy nor spendthrift.

### Away-from-home expenses 
As a rule of thumb, when travelling, expense any costs that you wouldn't incur if the trip wasn't happening. So you'd probably be buying a sandwich at lunch wherever you were but you probably wouldn't normally buy a 6am Leon at the airport. 

When you are travelling, again we want a culture of spending sensibly. 

- If there's a decent train route from the airport to the hotel and you have light bags then don't get a massive Uber. 
- But it's OK to spend a bit extra to travel at a convenient time or have a shorter journey. 
- When booking hotels look for the decent-but-no-frills options that get the job done without bringing home bed bugs. 

...You get the idea. 

### Drinks & entertaining

When buying drinks, the company can put in for the first round for clients or for the team but after that, it's less likely to be a 'business meeting' and so should move to personal costs. 

Where possible, take the clients for breakfast or light lunch. It's cheaper than a massive round at the bar and everyone will actually remember your conversation the next day!

### Work travel

According to HMRC, costs for your normal trip to work, or similar, are not eligible as expenses. At Stuart lives outside of London we cover his *extra* TFL costs but generally speaking, TFL travel is not eligible. If you incur extra travel costs above and beyond business-as-usual, it's fine to expense this.  

## £50 monthly clearance

* Everyone is cleared to spend upto £50 per month on things that will benefit the company. However please don't feel you *should* spend money, and please talk/email about your shopping to avoid double-purchasing, where we discuss something and two of us then buy it.

* For other expenses, always request authorisation first. Email [mailto:finance@good-loop.com Finance] with the subject "#finance _Your Name_ Expenses" with your request and obtain a budget. '''Unapproved expenses might not be repaid.'''


## Processing Expenses

1. If you have a company Revolut card please use this & upload VAT receipts for every transaction within the app. It takes just a few moments (more info here). 

2. If you don't, then you'll have to use your own card & claim it back via the Xero app. Again, always include a photo of the receipt with a VAT number please. 

In both instances, you'll be asked to classify the expense for the accountant. This is important because it decides where on the P&L the cost sits and it also has tax implications. 

* Keep the receipt; you will not be re-paid without a receipt, plus we need it for accountancy and to claim the VAT back.
** Is the receipt an email? Great - email [mailto:finance@sodash.com Finance].
** Is it a paper receipt? Enter it using the Xero app (note: not Xero Expenses) with a photo of the receipt.

* If you submit your expenses by the end of the day on the 16th of the month they will usually be re-paid to you in that month's pay. Any claim submitted after the 16th will usually be paid the following month. Just ask if this is a problem.

* Staff members submit (but do not approve) their own expenses to Xero.
* Expenses will be approved once a month (before payroll) by Amy and Dan Winterstein.
   * Amy will approve expenses for the London team, and for Dan W.
   * Dan W will approve expenses for the Edinburgh team, and for Amy.
   * However, if time is pressing, then either Amy or Dan can approve any expense entry.
* One Accounting can (and please do) authorise for payment all approved expenses as part of payroll.
* Expenses are then repaid as part of payroll.

## Classifying Expenses

 - Office costs: 
   - Computer Equipment
   - Office supplies 
   - Printing & stationary 

 - Travel - please categorise your expenses by:
   - Air travel 
   - Train travel 
   - Taxi travel
   - Accommodation 
   - Subsistence - (eg. dinner whilst travelling) 
   - Other travel costs (eg petrol)

 - International travel   
Any non-UK expenses will have different tax requirements. So:
In Xero - when you are entering expenses, there is a dropdown option to add an 'international' tag. 
In Revolut - add 'INT' plus the country name into the cost description. 

 - Entertainment
   - Client entertainment (if one or more client was present) 
   - Working lunches (food during meetings, no clients)
   - Staff entertainment (eg. a coffee during one-to-ones)
   - Staff conferences  (eg one-off internal events eg the Christmas party)

Please don't classify anything as **General Expenses** - it just gathers dust on the P&L and we have no idea what's in it. 
If you're unsure how to classify something just ask finance@good-loop.com.
