# Equal Opportunities & Diversity Policy

## 1. Introduction

Good-Loop recognises that it is essential to provide equal
opportunities to all persons without discrimination. This policy sets out the
company's position on equal opportunity in all aspects of employment,
including recruitment and promotion, and provides guidance and encouragement to
employees at all levels to act fairly and prevent discrimination.

By definition diversity comes in many shapes and sizes, including:  
gender (sexism), race (racism), nationality (xenophobia), marital & family status, disability (as defined by the Disability
Discrimination Act 1995 or otherwise), part-time and fixed term contract status, age, sexual
orientation, trans-status, religion (for clarity, anti-semitism is defined according to [1]), class, or neuro-diversity. These are the Diversity Categories for this policy -- we will also be open-minded about other categories which may get added to this policy as appropriate.

Good-Loop believes that diversity benefits the culture of the company.

Demographic data will be collected (at each employee's discretion) to provide a
picture of company diversity. Where it appears that a demographic group is
being under-represented, circumstances will be investigated to identify any
policies or criteria which exclude or discourage certain groups and, if so,
whether these are justifiable.

Diversity is not restricted to one area of operations. 
This policy applies to all areas of Good-Loop's operations, including
management, employees, sub-contractors, and suppliers.

## 2. Definition of Discrimination

(a) Discrimination can be direct or indirect. Both forms of discrimination must be avoided.

(b) Direct discrimination occurs when one person is treated less favourably
than another on grounds relating to the Diversity Categories. "Positive discrimination" is also a form of discrimination.

(c) Indirect discrimination occurs where a requirement is imposed which can be
complied with by a smaller proportion of persons of a particular Diversity Category, than persons in another group and which is not
objectively justifiable in the given situation. Examples include:

  - seeking job applications only from persons under 27 years of age and with five years' post-graduate experience;
  - demanding technical qualifications for a job which are not necessary;
  - sending only full time employees on training courses.

(d) Abusive or offensive behaviour and comments are unacceptable, especially when linked to a Diversity Category, 
and such behaviour is covered by this policy. 
It is important that our culture encourages diversity and respect, and that the work environment is a safe place 
for people of all types - whilst also being a place where people can express themselves. 
Behaviour is unacceptable when it would reasonably be expected
to cause offence, except where it is a reasonably justified difference of opinions. 
This includes whether or not such behaviour is explicitly directed at a person.

## 3. Statement of policy

(a) It is the policy of Good-Loop Ltd to ensure that no job
applicant, employee or supplier receives less favourable treatment on the grounds of the Diversity Categories, or is disadvantaged by conditions or
requirements that cannot be shown to be justifiable. The organisation is
committed not only to its legal obligations but also to the positive promotion
of equality of opportunity in all aspects of employment.

(b) It is the policy of Good-Loop Ltd to ensure that the workplace
is a safe and respectful environment for all people, regardless of Diversity Categories.

(c) The organisation recognises that adhering to the Equal Opportunities
Policy, combined with relevant employment policies and practices, maximises the
effective use of individuals in both the organisation's and employees' best
interests. Good-Loop recognises the great benefits in having a
diverse workforce with different backgrounds, solely employed on ability.

(d) The application of recruitment, training, and promotion policies to all
individuals will be on the basis of job requirements and the individual's
ability and merits.

(e) All employees of the organisation will be made aware of the provisions of this policy.

## 4. Recruitment and promotion

(a) Advertisements for posts will give sufficiently clear and accurate
information to enable potential applicants to assess their own suitability for
the post. Information about vacant posts will be provided in such a manner that
does not restrict its audience in terms of any Diversity Category unless that is 
objectively important for the job.

(b) Recruitment literature will not imply a preference for one group of
applicants unless there is a genuine occupational qualification which limits
the post to this particular group, in which case this must be clearly stated.

(c) All vacancies will be circulated internally. 

(d) To encourage diversity, whenever feasible, vacancies will be circulated via 
channels that encourage under-represented groups to apply, 
in addition to normal channels.

(d) All descriptions and specifications for posts will include only
requirements that are necessary and justifiable for the effective performance
of the job.

(e) All selection will be thorough, conducted against defined criteria and will
deal only with the applicant's suitability for the job. Where it is necessary
to ask questions relating to personal circumstances, these will be related
purely to job requirements and asked to all candidates.

## 5. Employment

(a) Good-Loop will not discriminate on the basis of any Diversity Category 
in the allocation of duties between employees
employed at any level with comparable job descriptions.

(b) Good-Loop will put in place any reasonable measures and/or
adjustments within the workplace for those employees who become disabled during
employment or for disabled appointees.

(c) All employees will be considered solely on their merits for career
development and promotion with equal opportunities for all.

(d) For transparency and to guard against any unfair pay differences, 
the company has an open pay policy, where employees are entitled to see the 
wages paid to others.

## 6. Suppliers and Sub-Contractors

(a) Good-Loop will not discriminate on the basis of any Diversity Category
in the selection of suppliers or sub-contractors.

(b) All tenders will be considered solely on their business merits with equal opportunities for all.


## 7. Training

(a) Employees will be provided with appropriate training regardless of Diversity Categories.

(b) All employees will be encouraged to discuss their career prospects and
training needs with their Line Manager or the HR Department.

## 8. Monitoring

(a) It is the responsibility of the Directors to ensure that this policy is kept under review and is operated throughout the
organisation.

(b) Where it appears that applicants/employees are not being offered equal
opportunities, circumstances will be investigated to identify any policies or
criteria which exclude or discourage certain employees and, if so, whether
these are justifiable.

(c) Demographic data will be collected (at each employee's discretion)
to provide a picture of company diversity. Where it appears that a
demographic group is being under-represented, circumstances will be
investigated to identify any policies or criteria which exclude or
discourage certain groups and, if so, whether these are justifiable.

## 9. Grievances and victimisation

(a) Good-Loop Ltd emphasises that discrimination and offensive behaviour are unacceptable
conduct which may lead to disciplinary action under the organisation's
Disciplinary Procedure.

(b) Accidental breaches of policy, for example an off-colour joke, will be handled as a matter for
training not discipline, except where such bevaiour is repeated or unapologetic.

(c) Any complaints of discrimination or offensive behaviour will be pursued through the organisation's Grievance Procedure.
