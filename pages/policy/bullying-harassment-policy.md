Policy: Bullying & Harassment

At Good-Loop we are fully committed to providing a working environment free from bullying and harassment. We strive to be a company full of decent humans who treat each other with kindness, dignity and respect. 

This policy covers bullying or harassment which occurs at work and out of the workplace, including on work trips or at work-related events or social functions. This policy applies to all staff at all levels including employees, management, agency and casual workers, and independent contractors.

What is harassment? 
Harassment is any unwanted conduct that has the purpose or effect of violating a person's dignity or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for them. It is unlawful under the Equality Act 2010 to harass a person because of their age, disability, gender reassignment, marital or civil partner status, pregnancy or maternity, race, colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin, religion or belief, sex or sexual orientation. It also includes conduct of a sexual nature (sexual harassment). 

What is bullying?
Bullying is offensive, intimidating, malicious or insulting behaviour, an abuse or misuse of power through means that undermine, humiliate, denigrate or injure the recipient. Bullying may be physical, verbal or non-verbal. Legitimate and reasonable criticism of a staff memberâ€™s performance or behaviour, or reasonable management instructions, do not amount to bullying. 


------


Bullying and harassment are not tolerated in our workplace and all staff are required to treat each other, along with our customers, suppliers, and visitors, with kindness, dignity and respect. Breaches of this policy will be dealt with in accordance with our disciplinary procedure. Serious cases of bullying or harassment may amount to gross misconduct resulting in dismissal.

Staff who make complaints or who participate in good faith in any investigation must not suffer any form of retaliation or victimisation as a result. 

Making a false allegation deliberately and in bad faith will also be treated as misconduct and dealt with under our disciplinary procedure.

The Process 

Step 1 
If you believe you are being harassed or bullied, you may wish to raise the problem informally with the person responsible. Explain the situation and how it has made you feel. It can be helpful to describe the event so the other person is clear about your concerns. Use the opportunity to ask the person to change or stop their behaviour. Alternatively you may speak to your line manager who can provide confidential advice and assistance in resolving the issue informally.

Step 2
If you do not feel that informal steps are appropriate, or they have been unsuccessful, you should raise the matter formally. Once a formal grievance has been raised, two senior members of the Good-Loop team (ideally including the individual's line manager) will investigate by gathering and reviewing evidence and by speaking to both parties. You can also ask to have the Staff Representative or an outside friend present during these meetings, for support. 

Please keep accusations confidential during an investigation. This allows for a fairer investigation, and also minimises the harm if there was a misunderstanding. However people should not feel isolated in stressful times, so you can speak about it to your line manager, a close friend or partner (asking them to keep it confidential), or health professionals (including a counsellor or therapist).

Step 3
If the complaint is upheld, we will begin a disciplinary procedure. If the complaint is not upheld, the accused individual will have their name cleared. In either case we will consider how best to manage any ongoing working relationship between you and the person concerned. 

Our first priority is the well-being of staff. If possible, disciplinary measures should be corrective rather than punitive.
