# Policy: Bullying & Harassment

At Good-Loop we are fully committed to providing a working environment free from bullying and harassment. We strive to be a company full of decent humans who treat each other with kindness, dignity and respect. 

This policy covers bullying or harassment which occurs at work and out of the workplace, including on work trips or at work-related events or social functions. This policy applies to all staff at all levels including employees, management, agency and casual workers, and independent contractors.

## What is harassment? 

Harassment is any unwanted conduct that has the purpose or effect of violating a person's dignity or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for them. It is unlawful under the Equality Act 2010 to harass a person because of their age, disability, gender reassignment, marital or civil partner status, pregnancy or maternity, race, colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin, religion or belief, sex or sexual orientation. It also includes conduct of a sexual nature (sexual harassment). 

## What is bullying?

Bullying is offensive, intimidating, malicious or insulting behaviour, an abuse or misuse of power through means that undermine, humiliate, denigrate or injure the recipient. Bullying may be physical, verbal or non-verbal. Legitimate and reasonable criticism of a staff memberâ€™s performance or behaviour, or reasonable management instructions, do not amount to bullying. 

## Bullying and Harassment are Not Tolerated

Bullying and harassment are not tolerated in our workplace and all staff are required to treat each other, along with our customers, suppliers, and visitors, with kindness, dignity and respect. Breaches of this policy will be dealt with in accordance with the [Disciplinary Procedure](disciplinary-procedure.html). Serious cases of bullying or harassment may amount to gross misconduct resulting in dismissal.

Staff who make complaints or who participate in good faith in any investigation must not suffer any form of retaliation or victimisation as a result. 

Making a false allegation deliberately and in bad faith would also be treated as misconduct and dealt with under our disciplinary procedure. 


## The Process 

If you believe you are being harassed or bullied, please follow the [grievance procedure](grievance-procedure.html).

Our first priority is the well-being of staff. If possible, disciplinary measures should be corrective rather than punitive.
