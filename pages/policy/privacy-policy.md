## 3. Circumstances In Which We May Share Your Personal Information

*   First and foremost, we will <u>never</u> sell your personal data unless you explicitly authorise that.

*   Your personal information may however be made available to our partners, with your consent, when:
    *   you sign up for our newsletter;
    *   you otherwise connect with a partner, including sending messages through Good-Loop; or
    *   We may also share your personal information with third parties if we are under a duty to share your personal information in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply such other terms as apply to our relationship, or to protect the rights, property, for the purposes of any legal dispute, or safety of our customers, ourselves or others (including exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection).

*   We may share anonymised and aggregated information about our customers/users to third parties, such as our clients, to allow them to reach the kind of audience they want to target. Aggregated Data may be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your usage data to calculate the percentage of users viewing a specific advertising campaign.

*   We may publish this anonymised or aggregate data in statistical form for Good-Loop promotional purposes, or to assist charities in understanding the pattern of donations.


## 4.  Transferring Your Personal Information Internationally

*   In certain cases the sharing of your personal information to a third party as described above may involve your personal information being transferred outside of the United Kingdom. 
For example, our servers are located in Germany, a country in the EEA and therefore subject to the GDPR, therefore offering the same safeguards in respect of your personal data.

*   Where personal data is transferred to a country which is not considered to have the same standards of protection for personal data as those in the United Kingdom, we will take all steps required by law to ensure sufficient protections are in place to safeguard your personal information, including where appropriate putting in place contractual terms approved by the relevant regulatory authorities.

<!--
Note if we were to upload data to eg BlueKai (Oracle) who are based in the USA. We'd need to ensure that they don't store any of your user data in the USA. 
The Schrems ii case deemed USA's surveillance powers unlawful, and thus not providing sufficient privacy protection. Servers need to be outside USA.

Mailchimp – US company - but they seem to be OK post Schrems II.

## 5.  Retention, Updating And Removal Of Your Personal Information

*   <u>Data Retention</u>

The duration for which we retain your personal information will differ depending on the type of information and the reason why we collected it from you. For example, when we monitor our advertising activity via your IP address, your IP address will automatically be deleted after one month. However, if you register for an account with us we will need to retain your personal information for longer, for example until you close the account, or for example for at least six years in accordance with usual commercial practice, potential legal disputes and regulatory requirements.

*   <u>Accuracy</u>

When you register for an account it is important to ensure that the personal information we hold about you is accurate and up-to-date, and you should let us know if anything changes, including if you change your contact details. You can update some of the personal information we hold about you on our website. Alternatively, you can contact us using the details in paragraph 10.

*   <u>Removal</u>

If you want to stop receiving any information from us, such as news and updates, please let us know by updating your preferences through our website or contacting us using the details in paragraph 10. It may take up to one month to unsubscribe you from marketing.

Your decision to stop receiving information from us or to delete your account may result in the deletion of some of the personal information that we hold about you, but we may still retain personal information required for other purposes, including where we are legally required to do so.

*   <u>Erasure</u>

You may request the erasure of personal information that we hold about you. To make a deletion request, please contact us, providing full details of the personal information you want to be erased. We will consider all requests upon receipt. We may ask for additional information, for example to verify your identity. You have the right to delete most data, though some data has to be kept for legal reasons.
