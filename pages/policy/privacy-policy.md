1.  **CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH WE MAY SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

*   First and foremost, we will <u>never</u> sell your personal data.

*   Your personal information may however be made available to our partners, with your consent, when:

    *   you sign up for our newsletter;

    *   you otherwise connect with a partner, including sending messages through Good-Loop; or

    *   We may also share your personal information with third parties if we are under a duty to share your personal information in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply such other terms as apply to our relationship, or to protect the rights, property, for the purposes of any legal dispute, or safety of our customers, ourselves or others (including exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection).

*   We may share anonymised and aggregated information about our customers/users to third parties, such as our clients, to allow them to reach the kind of audience they want to target. Aggregated Data may be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your usage data to calculate the percentage of users viewing a specific advertising campaign.

*   We may publish this anonymised or aggregate data in statistical form for Good-Loop promotional purposes, or to assist charities in understanding the pattern of donations.

1.  **TRANSFERRING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION INTERNATIONALLY**

*   In certain cases the sharing of your personal information to a third party as described above may involve your personal information being transferred outside of the United Kingdom. For example, our servers are located in Germany, a country in the European Economic Area, that is subject to the General Data protection Regulation (GDPR) and is therefore considered to have data protection rules that are equivalent to those in the United Kingdom.

*   Where personal data is transferred to a country which is not considered to have the same standards of protection for personal data as those in the United Kingdom, we will take all steps required by law to ensure sufficient protections are in place to safeguard your personal information, including where appropriate putting in place contractual terms approved by the relevant regulatory authorities.

Potential problem here - BlueKai (Oracle) are based in the USA. You need to ensure that they don't store any of your user data in the USA. They should have said something about this recently following the Schrems ii case, which deemed USA's surveillance powers unlawful, and thus not providing sufficient privacy protection. Servers need to be outside USA.

Mailchimp – US company. How are they storing data post Schrems II case?

1.  **RETENTION, UPDATING AND REMOVAL OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

*   <u>Data Retention</u>

The duration for which we retain your personal information will differ depending on the type of information and the reason why we collected it from you. For example, when we monitor our advertising activity via your IP address, your IP address will automatically be deleted after one month. However, if you register for an account with us we will need to retain your personal information for longer, for example until you close the account, or for example for at least six years in accordance with usual commercial practice, potential legal disputes and regulatory requirements.

*   <u>Accuracy</u>

When you register for an account it is important to ensure that the personal information we hold about you is accurate and up-to-date, and you should let us know if anything changes, including if you change your contact details.

1.  **SECURITY**

*   The protection of your personal information is very important to us and we have in place various security measures to ensure that your personal information is kept secure.

*   However, you should be aware that the method you use to get in contact with us, such as email or blog, may not be entirely secure and your personal information may be susceptible to being intercepted in transit. Equally, your personal information is at risk if a malicious third party gains access to your Good-Loop account or to any other place where your personal information is stored, such as your email account.
