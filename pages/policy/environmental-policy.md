# Environmental Policy

## Introduction

Good-Loop recognises that, in pursuing its commercial and research objectives, it shares with all
organisations a responsibility to protect and nurture the environment. By exercising proper
control over its activities, Good-Loop will promote the use of sustainable resources and discourage
practices that are wasteful or damaging to the environment.

This policy contains a variety of practical measures to be taken in order to enable Good-Loop to
make a contribution towards protecting the environment at all levels of our activity.
A twice-yearly review of the policy will enable monitoring of achievements, and will identify
opportunities for further improvements.

## Key Aims

 - To reduce unfavourable impact on the natural environment of Good-Loop through our work and consumption.
 - To conserve and support use of sustainable resources.
 - To follow "the waste hierarchy":
   1. Reduce;
   2. Reuse or reclaim;
   3. Recover (Recycle);
   4. Dispose - as last resort.
 - To establish and follow environmental good practice, and comply with all relevant environmental regulations and legislations.
 - To develop organisational awareness of the need to care for the environment, and measures that can be taken.                                                                  1

## Carbon neutrality

Good-Loop aims to be carbon neutral. Each year we will calculate our carbon footprint and offset this by purchasing carbon credits from an appropriately certified supplier. We use data-centres that are 100% powered by renewable energy.
