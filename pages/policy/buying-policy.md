Policy on how the company shops.

Part of being an ethical company with a positive impact is how we buy and consume as a company.

This policy does not affect how staff do their personal shopping. You can still get your personal blood diamonds delivered to the office.

## Fair Trade First 

If a fair trade option is available, then buy that in preference to non-Fair-Trade. E.g. coffee and tea should be fair trade.

## Reduce, Reuse, Recycle (and buy 2nd Hand)

Minimise our environmental impact by buying second-hand where possible and appropriate.

## Amazon Last

For delivered goods, check and buy from other sources in preference to Amazon.

Why? Amazon treat their warehouse workers considerably worse than others. e.g. ref http://digg.com/2018/amazon-workers-pee, or https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/31/amazon-accused-of-treating-uk-warehouse-staff-like-robots

## Avoid Bad Suppliers 

All suppliers should follow basic ethical practices, as appropriate for their industry.

## Ethical Premiums are OK 

When choosing suppliers, you can spend 20% more to work with a supplier who has a better positive impact. 
For larger price differences: consider and talk to management.
