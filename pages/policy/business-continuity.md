# Business Continuity Plan

Good-Loop aims to respond rapidly and effectively to emergencies in a way that
minimizes disruption to our client engagements and other operations.

## People

To ensure that projects can continue even if the lead person suffers
serious illness or injury, secondary people are kept briefed on the
engagement.

## Documents and systems

All digital assets are stored in a secure off-site repository. This repository is
replicated to two further locations nightly. Databases are also backed
up on a nightly basis and replicated off-site.

Together these measures ensure that we have a scalable infrastructure
with multiple redundancies. This infrastructure can be rapidly repaired
in the event of disaster or catastrophic hardware failure. 

## Workplace

Good-Loop's work does not rely upon our office. All our researchers
have the capacity to work both when on location and from home. All
documents and software code are stored using multiple off-site
repositories (see *documents and systems* above). We can therefore
recover even from a serious office disaster such as fire or flood with
only minor disruption.

## Financial

Good-Loop operates a careful financial policy. A percentage of profit
is retained to provide a solid buffer against financial changes.
