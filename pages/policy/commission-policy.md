## End-of-Year (Christmas) Bonus

Each year, there is an end of year bonus paid in December, based on overall commercial performance.

A typical amount might be £500 per person for hitting the commercial performance targets, and £1,000 for reaching the commercial stretch goals.

Histoprically, the Good-Loop team have so far always hit not only our performance targets but also our stretch goals.
