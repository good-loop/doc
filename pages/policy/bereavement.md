# Bereavement Policy

If a staff member suffers the death of a close family member, then they receive:

- 1 week (5 working days, pro-rata) paid leave by default. 
  - 2 weeks (10 working days, pro-rata) if a parent loses a child under 18.
- A further week of paid leave, made available if asked for.
- If after that, they're not comfortable or ready for returning, that's discussed case by case. 
- There won't be a formal return to work policy in the case of bereavement - allowing people to do what works for them. 
- If you return to work, and find that it's too soon and you're not ready - that's ok, and further leave can be discussed with your line manager. 

Taking leave after bereavement isn't compulsory, but taking at least 1 week is recommended for a myriad of reasons 
(if you feel unaffected, that's usually a sign you are). 

If a staff member loses any relative or friend, they can have time off to attend the funeral.

## Who counts as close family?

By default: parents, partners (whether married or not), brothers, sisters, and children.

However the company aims to be understanding around other cases. What matters is the person's emotional relationship with the deceased. 
The loss of a close friend can cause as much grief. Line managers should handle each case with consideration and empathy.

## Contractors

For contractors, we aim to be understanding and considerate. This is handled on a case-by-case basis. It could include: 

 - Paying something towards a week of paid leave.
 - Being understanding about shifting a deadline.
