# Bereavement and Compassionate Leave Policy

## Loss of a close family member

If a staff member suffers the death of a close family member, then they receive:

- 1 week (5 working days, pro-rata) paid leave by default. 
- 2 weeks (10 working days, pro-rata) if a parent loses a child under 18.
- A further week of paid leave, made available if asked for.
- If after that, they're not comfortable or ready for returning, that's discussed case by case. Further leave is available but would normally be unpaid.
- There won't be a formal return to work policy in the case of bereavement - allowing people to do what works for them. 
- If you return to work, and find that it's too soon and you're not ready - that's ok, and further leave can be discussed with your line manager. 

Taking leave after bereavement isn't compulsory, but taking at least 1 week is recommended for a myriad of reasons 
(if you feel unaffected, that's usually a sign you are). 

## Who counts as close family?

By default: parents, partners (whether married or not), brothers, sisters, and children. A miscarriage is also the loss of a close family member.

However the company aims to be understanding around other cases. What matters is the person's emotional relationship with the deceased. 
The loss of a very close friend can cause as much grief. Line managers should handle each case with consideration and empathy.

## Loss of a relative or friend

If a staff member loses any relative (including an in-law) or a friend, they can have a day off as paid leave to attend the funeral.

## Contractors

For contractors, we aim to be understanding and considerate. This is handled on a case-by-case basis. It could include: 

 - Paying something towards a week of paid time-off.
 - Being understanding about shifting a deadline.
