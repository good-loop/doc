# (draft) Grievance Procedure 

Status: This is a draft. IT is NOT active yet.

This procedure is for staff who wish to raise a complaint.
See alo the [Grievance Procedure] for managers disciplining a staff member or contractor.

## Dealing with grievances informally
If you have a grievance or complaint to do with your work or the people you work with you should, wherever possible, start by talking it over with your manager. You may be able to agree a solution informally between you.

## Formal grievance
If the matter is serious and/or you wish to raise the matter formally you should set out the grievance in writing to your manager. You should stick to the facts and avoid language that is insulting or abusive.

Where your grievance is against your manager and you feel unable to approach him or her you should talk to another manager or the owner.

## Grievance hearing

Your manager will call you to a meeting, normally within five days, to discuss your grievance. You have the right to be accompanied by a colleague or trade union representative at this meeting if you make a reasonable request.

After the meeting the manager will give you a decision in writing, normally within 24 hours.

If it is necessary to gather further information before making a decision your manger will inform you of this and the likely timescale involved.

## Appeal
If you are unhappy with your manager's decision and you wish to appeal you should let your manager know.

You will be invited to an appeal meeting, normally within five days, and your appeal will be heard by a more senior manager (or the company owner). 

You have the right to be accompanied by a colleague or trade union representative at this meeting if you make a reasonable request.
After the meeting the manager (or owner) will give you a decision, normally within 24 hours. The manager's (or owner's) decision is final.
