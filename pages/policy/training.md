# Training policy

> "The only thing worse than training your employees and maybe they leave, is not training them and maybe they stay."

Good-Loop recognises that its most important resource is its
employees.  It is committed to the training and development of its entire
workforce so that they will gain the necessary skills to reach their full
potential. This will assist in enabling the organisation to achieve its aims
and objectives that are to provide specialised, high quality care and
rehabilitation to vulnerable people through a well trained and supported
working team. By increasing the skills and knowledge of its staff the organisation will produce confident,
highly qualified staff working as an effective and efficient team.

The individual training and development needs will be identified through:

 - An annual performance appraisal
 - Requests from employees.

The training and development needs identified will be met through a variety of
activities depending on the nature and extent of the requirements deemed
necessary after assessment.

All internal training provided by the organisation will be of no cost to the
employee. External courses and professional qualifications may be fully or
partly funded by the organisation depending on the nature of the training.

Employees are encouraged to take responsibility for their own development and may inform the
organisation of their development needs.

As part of the organisation's continuing commitment to training and
development, employees are asked to provide feedback on the value and
effectiveness of the training and development they undertake. This information
will be used to assess and improve the training process.

This policy respects equal opportunities and applies to all employees.
