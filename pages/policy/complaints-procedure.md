# (draft) Complaints handling procedure

If a client or viewer wishes to make a complaint they should find it easy to do so. 
We look upon complaints as an opportunity to learn, adapt, improve and provide a better service. This
policy is intended to ensure that complaints are dealt with properly and that all complaints or
comments by customers are taken seriously. 

Most complaints, if dealt with early, openly and honestly, can be sorted
out amicably.

The policy is not designed to apportion blame, to consider the possibility of negligence or to
provide compensation, nor is it part of our disciplinary policy.

## Goals

• Customers and their representatives are aware of how to complain, and that Thomas Roofing
provides easy to use opportunities for them to register their complaints
• A named person will be responsible for the administration of the procedure. • Every written complaint is acknowledged within two working days
• Investigations into written complaints are held within 28 days
• All complaints are responded to in writing by Thomas Roofing
• Complaints are dealt with promptly, fairly and sensitively with due regard to the upset and
worry that they can cause to both Thomas Roofing and their customers.. The named manager, with responsibility for dealing with complaints, is Steven Ashley.

Complaints Procedure

## Procedure

• All oral complaints, no matter how seemingly unimportant, should be taken seriously. There is
nothing to be gained by adopting a defensive or aggressive attitude. 
• Employees who receive an oral complaint should seek to solve the problem
immediately if possible.
 • If staff cannot solve the problem immediately they should offer to refer the matter to the
complaints manager to deal with the problem. • All contact with the complainant should be polite, courteous and sympathetic. • At all times staff should remain calm and respectful. • Thomas Roofing Employees should not accept blame, make excuses or blame other
employees. • If the complaint is being made on behalf of the customer by an advocate it must first be
verified that the person has permission to speak for the customer, especially if confidential
information is involved. It is very easy to assume that the advocate has the right or power to
act for the customer when they may not. If in doubt it should be assumed that the customer’s
explicit permission is needed prior to discussing the complaint with the advocate. • After talking the problem through, each manager or the member of staff dealing with the
complaint should suggest a course of action to resolve the complaint. If this course of action is
acceptable then the member of staff should clarify the agreement with the complainant and
agree a way in which the results of the complaint will be communicated to the complainant (ie
through another meeting or by letter). • If the suggested plan of action is not acceptable to the complainant then the member of staff or
manager should ask the complainant to put their complaint in writing to the Thomas Roofing
and give them a copy of the complaints procedure and form for completion. • In both cases details of the complaint should be recorded on a complaint form. 

## Written Complaints

• When a complaint is received in writing it should be passed on to a complaints
manager who should record it in the complaints book and send an acknowledgment letter
within two working days. The complaints manager will be the named person who deals with
the complaint through the process.
• If necessary, further details should be obtained from the complainant. If the complaint is not
made by the customer but on the customer’s behalf, then consent of the customer, preferably
in writing, must be obtained from the customer. 
• A copy of the complaint’s procedure will be given to the customer.
 • If the complaint raises potentially serious matters, advice should be sought from a legal
advisor. If legal action is taken at this stage any investigation by Thomas Roofing under the
complaints procedure should cease immediately.
 • Immediately on receipt of the complaint Thomas Roofing should launch an investigation and
within 28 days should be in a position to provide a full explanation to the complainant, either
in writing or by arranging a meeting with the individuals concerned.
 • If the issues are too complex to complete the investigation within 28 days, the complainant
should be informed of any delays.
• If a meeting is arranged the complainant should be advised that they may, if they wish, bring a
friend or relative or a representative such as an advocate. • At the meeting a detailed explanation of the results of the investigation should be given and
also an apology if it is deemed appropriate (apologising for what has happened need not be an
admission of liability).
 • Such a meeting gives Thomas Roofing the opportunity to show the complainant that the matter
has been taken seriously and has been thoroughly investigated. • After the meeting, or if the complainant does not want a meeting, a written account of the
investigation should be sent to the complainant. This should include details of how to
approach Which? Trusted Trader if the complainant is not satisfied with the outcome. • The outcomes of the investigation and the meeting should be recorded on appropriate
documentation and any shortcomings in Thomas Roofing’s procedures should be identified
and acted upon.
 • This complaints procedure should be audited by the management annually.
