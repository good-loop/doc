# Legal and Emergency Fund

Legal issues, for example around visas, are often stressful. 
There are also emergencies which can create unexpected costs -- e.g. a medical emergency on holiday.
The Legal and Emergency Fund is to support our team members in such times of stress.

Staff can claim upto Â£200 a year towards legal and related costs, or emergency costs
 -- including the costs of a partner or dependent.

To make a claim: Please talk to your manager first (if possible), as payments are at the company's discretion. Please keep invoices / receipts (where possible), as these must be submitted with your claim.
