## Meaningful User Rights

New laws in Europe (eg. GDPR) and some US states have provided the public with more rights. But rights mean little if only a small digital elite can use them. We must provide easy-to-use tools for the public.

We are working with digital-rights charity the Open Rights Group on a way to provide solid legal safeguards that will continue even after an exit. Our data and AI plans are checked by an internal Ethics Committee.

## AI and Inference

Inference can be helpful, reducing the need to fill in tiresome forms. But data can reveal more than people realise, e.g. movie likes are correlated with politics and sexuality.

We will inform users what we infer, and give them control over that data. We will treat inferred data as private and apply the same user rights. We will not hide behind algorithms, but instead use explainable AI.

## Data Buying

Most advertisers now expect basic targeting: gender, approximate age, and country. To provide this, we use 3rd party data from the Data Management Platform (DMP) *BlueKai*. BlueKai is used by reputable publishers such as The Huffington Post, The New York Times, and The Guardian. We also use targeting services from Snap and Facebook when advertising on their platforms.

Targeting avoids wasted ads, and enables a long-tail of diverse businesses (e.g. niche creative shops, and products for minorities). We are not against targeting itself, though we are against its abuse. The broad targeting we use meets our ethical standards.

## Data Collection

A tiny amount of data is collected regardless using anonymous tokens, to avoid repeat showing of the same ad, and to protect against fraud. This data is not stored long term.

Rich data profiles are only collected with user consent. That consent must be informed, and not obtained via a nuisance pop-up. We are able to get consent, because users support what we do. The offer to them is: Boost your charity donations by letting us collect and use data.
Users can see and control what data we hold. They can opt out of data collection with one click from our privacy policy. They can easily change their mind later.

## Selling Data Services

We do not sell or share data. Longer term, we plan to provide DMP services â€“ on behalf of our users, and only with their permission. These services will be provided carefully so as to preserve privacy. We will report back to users, and use 50% of the revenue to fund their charities.

## Red Lines

All adverts must meet Good-Loop's ethical criteria.

 - We will never support manipulation, e.g. through political dark-ads.
 - We will never support exploiting vulnerable groups.
 - We will never use dark patterns to trick users into giving more consent than they wish.
 - We will never sell or share user data without user authorisation, unless there is a legal requirement to do so.
