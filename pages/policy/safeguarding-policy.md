# Safeguarding Children and Vulnerable Adults Policy

We are committed to providing safe online spaces for all users.

We aim to make our software *safe by design*, including safeguarding concerns as part of the 
software design process.

Our software should be proactive in establishing a user's limits, then protecting them.

It goes without saying that child users and vulnerable adults should never be exploited. 

Extra care should be taken around risk areas, including money handling, sensitive data, and
data that might put someone at risk (for example, precise location data).

Were it to become appropriate, for example if staff were to work directly with children or vulnerable adults,
we will carry out up to date criminal records checks. This does not affect our current work.
