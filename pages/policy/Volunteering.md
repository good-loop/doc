Volunteering

At Good-Loop, we want to encourage our team to put back into their community and society. We do this through empowering our team to volunteer their time and skills. 

Good-Loop will cover 8hrs per month in paid time off for volunteering, which is not deductible from your holiday allowance.

If you wish to take more time off for volunteering, Good-Loop can provide an additional 8hrs per month, but unpaid. 

At the end of the year, be sure to let us know about your volunteering efforts and you'll be included in our end of year impact - distributed to leading organisations and charities, and getting your good news out there! Stay tuned for the 'Loopies' awards, designed to recognise these efforts.
