# Good-Loop Documentation

Refactor of the Good-Loop documentation. Website builder changed from [jerbil](https://github.com/good-loop/jerbil) to [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).

# Build 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
mkdocs build
```

A static site will be generated in the `site` directory.
